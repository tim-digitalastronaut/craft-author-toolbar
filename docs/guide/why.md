# About the toolbar

## The problem

The author toolbar plugin provides a frontend toolbar that enhances the overall authoring experience for Craft CMS projects. It integrates seamlessly with all Craft projects as it doesn't depend on any other Craft CMS plugins being installed for capturing the nessecary data.

The toolbar features are aimed at authors with little to sometimes no prior CMS or web development experience. Its main goal is to connect the content on the frontend to the control panel in a more user friendly fashion.
