# About the toolbar

## The motivation behind the plugin

When we deliver Craft CMS project to <u>**clients that haven't worked with Craft**</u> or any other CMS they <u>**often times get confused when learning.**</u> This creates extra hassle for us devs but also leaves clients feeling bad eventhough the project turned out like they wanted. We always provide a training for these types of clients and a personalised manual but even with these measures we see the same difficulties always returning.

### Most common problem

The biggest one we've noticed is understanding the link between entries in Craft and frontend pages. It's pretty abstract for clients to know how their content is being displayed. Some entries don't have url's some do. Some pages (sections) are fixed (singles) whilst others are flexible (structures/channels). On top of that not every agency builds craft in the same way. It's way better than wordpress, but how entries and sections are strucutred still differs from agency to agency. This makes finding the edit page for some a challange that shouldn't be wasting their time.

It's this problem together with some smaller other ones such as:

1. Authors not knowing or forgetting basic SEO criterea for pages
    1. No meta description
    2. Not enough content
    3. Missing alt tags
2. Getting help / bug reporting
3. More efficient & Straight forward authoring experience

That we want to help solve with this plugin.

## What does the plugin provide?

The author toolbar plugin provides a frontend toolbar that enhances the overall authoring experience for Craft CMS projects by <u>**providing a better link between the control panel and the frontend pages.**</u> It integrates seamlessly with all Craft projects as it doesn't depend on any other Craft CMS plugins being installed for capturing the nessecary data.

The toolbar features are aimed at authors with little to sometimes no prior CMS or web development experience. Its main goal is to connect the content on the frontend to the control panel in a more user friendly fashion.
